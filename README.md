This application creates a one day planner for the 8 am - 5 pm work hours on the current day (today).
Today's date appears near the top of the page.
The present hour block, if it is between 8 am and 5 pm, will appear with an orange background.
Any past hour blocks will have a gray background and blocks for later in the day will be green.
The user can input an "to do" item" for each time block.
The input text can be saved by hitting the "save" button for that row.
Even when the website is refreshed, the data will persist until it is changed and saved.

The application can be found at the following website:  https://rebecca-diroll.github.io/05-Scheduler/
